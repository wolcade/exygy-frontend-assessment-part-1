# Exygy Frontend Assessment

Here is my completed assessment! There are still a few things I would have liked to improve given the time, and I look forward to discussing more with you all! Thank you again for the opportunity. This was a fun project!

This project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and Typescript.

[Bloom](https://www.exygy.com/housing) is an Exygy product that helps people learn about and apply for affordable housing listings. Taking inspiration from Bloom, this assessment asks you to build a visual directory of housing listings.

We want you to use this repo as a starting point to build a single page application using React that displays the included mock listing data in a vertical list where each listing looks like the card in [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/tN29n4dzig6pHz9uNIygcD/Frontend-Skills-Assessment?node-id=0%3A1). The password for file access is `best_of_luck!`.

Your result doesn’t have to be pixel-perfect, but we are interested in seeing how closely and cleanly you can recreate the design. This kind of ask is something you would find yourself doing in this role.

Create React App sets up Jest and React Testing Library for you if you would like to write unit tests, but we are not asking for unit tests.

We know that any at-home work in an interview process requires your time, and we want to be respectful of that time while also ensuring this role is a good fit for you. Please do not spend more than 3 hours on this assessment. If you run out of time to complete what you wanted, that’s okay! We look forward to having a conversation with you about what you completed.

If you do not anticipate having the space to complete this assessment, please let us know, and we will work with you to find alternatives. There is not a harsh deadline on returning the assessment after receiving it.

We ask that you do not use any outside design system libraries (like Material UI or Bootstrap), but you are free to use more low-level CSS tools if you wish (like Tailwind, Emotion, SASS).

You can share your project with us as a repo on GitHub (@seanmalbert, @ludtkemorgan, @emilyjablonski, @yazeedloonat, @kramduckner, @colinbuyck, @adriencyberspace) or as a zip file in your email chain. We look forward to seeing it!
